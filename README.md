# MMPersistence

A Python library for mathematical-morphology (MM)–based filtrations and persistent-homology computations, built using GUDHI and Persim. The latest version (2025.12.01) focuses on 2D binary images and leverages MM operations—erosion, dilation, opening, and closing—to construct filtrations for computing persistent homology and persistence diagrams. For grayscale images, this version also provides basic tools for analyzing MM-based features and the persistence information of topological structures within grayscale intensity patterns.
